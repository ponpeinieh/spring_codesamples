- Declarative transaction scope
    - Both the Spring and JPA @Transaction annotation allow you to define the scope of a given application transaction.
    - So, if a service method is annotated with the @Transactional annotation, it will run in a transactional context. 
    - If the service method uses multiple DAO or Repositories, all read and write operations will be executed in the same database transaction.

- **Spring @Transactional**
    - The `org.springframework.transaction.annotation.Transactional` annotation has been available since the 1.2 version of the Spring framework (circa 2005), and it allows you to set the following transactional properties:

        - `isolation`: the underlying database isolation level
        - `noRollbackFor` and `noRollbackForClassName`: the list of Java Exception classes that can be triggered without triggering a transaction rollback
        - `rollbackFor` and `rollbackForClassName`: the list of Java Exception classes that trigger a transaction rollback when being thrown
        - `propagation`: the transaction propagation type given by the Propagation Enum. For instance, if the transaction context can be inherited (e.g., REQUIRED) or a new transaction context should be created (e.g., REQUIRES_NEW) or if an exception should be thrown if no transaction context is present (e.g., MANDATORY) or if an exception should be thrown if a current transaction context is found (e.g., NOT_SUPPORTED).
        - `readOnly`: whether the current transaction should only read data without applying any changes.
        - `timeout`: how many seconds should the transaction context be allowed to run until a timeout exception is thrown.
        - `value` or `transactionManager`: the name of the Spring TransactionManager bean to be used when binding the transaction context.
- **Java EE @Transactional**
    - The `javax.transaction.Transactional` annotation was added by the Java EE 7 specification (circa 2013). So, the Java EE annotation was added 8 years later than its Spring counterpart.
    - The Java EE @Transactional defines just 3 attributes:
        - `dontRollbackOn`: the list of Java Exception classes that can be triggered without triggering a transaction rollback
        - `rollbackOn`: the list of Java Exception classes that trigger a transaction rollback when being thrown
        - `value`: the propagation strategy, given by the TxType Enum. For instance, if the transaction context can be inherited (e.g., REQUIRED) or a new transaction context should be created (e.g., REQUIRES_NEW) or if an exception should be thrown if no transaction context is present (e.g., MANDATORY) or if an exception should be thrown if a current transaction context is found (e.g., NOT_SUPPORTED).
- Which one to choose?
    - If you're using Spring or Spring Boot, then use the Spring @Transactional annotation, as it allows you to configure more attributes than the Java EE @Transactional annotation.
    - If you are using Java EE alone, and you deploy your application on a Java EE application server, then use the Java EE @Transactional annotation.
